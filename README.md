This site examines economic inequality in America using US Census data. 
The user can click on a given county, which is shaded according to its
level of inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient.

This drills down into a more in-depth comparison between groups. At this point, 
the user can select specific populations and directly compare their income distributions.

Looking at the example above, let's imagine that the user clicks on Cook County, Illinois. They are interested in 
exploring the income differences of highly educated men and women in this region. From the boxplot
on the left, we see that the median man with a Master's Degree is at the 75th percentile for women
with the same level of education. This points towards significant gender inequality.

This kind of analysis can be replicated across every county in the US, allowing the user to compare race, 
education, gender, and age variables and see how that effects inequality in their region. This tool is designed
for policy makers, teachers, students, and interested citizens that want to see what economic inequality really 
looks like in their area.
