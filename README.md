This site examines economic inequality in America using US Census data. 
The user can click on a given county, which is shaded according to its
level of inequality as measured by the Gini coefficient.

This drills down into a more in-depth comparison between groups. At this point, 
the user can select specific populations and directly compare their income distributions.

For instance, the user can click on Cook County, Illinois. Then they could compare the income
distribution of men vs women in Cook County. But, they can go further by adding a control variable,
and specifying education, race, or age.
